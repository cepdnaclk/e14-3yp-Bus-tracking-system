## Introduction

A lot of people do not like to travel in crowded buses. We would love to travel sitting, sleeping. It will be very useful if there is a system to know whether the next bus on our route is full or not, to know the location of that bus, to know whether there are any alternative buses on route and etc.

So we came up with a solution which is an embedded system and huge network of various devices. Real-time bus data, which comes from the bus tracking system, shows the expected time in minutes until the arrival of the relevant bus. Customers can view this anticipated arrival time at a location via an app, website or, where available on the public information display system at the bus stop.  

The main purpose in this idea is to check whether the buses are heavily loaded and late. So that if a person is willing to use another way of transportation, he can use that considering the information given by the system.

After all, the collected data will be very valuable also. They can be used to analyse and check which route has heavy load of people, whether the time differences among buses should be adjusted and should there be more buses in a route in a particular time and any more.
